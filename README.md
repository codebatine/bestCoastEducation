# JavaScript Assignment

## Description

A Proof-of-Conceppt application as part of a JavaSccript course. To make an application with javascript that lists courses, shows details about courses, offers register/sign in and an application to add new courses.

## Present courses

I did this with a data.json that is dynamically created with javascript.

## Make a details-page of the courses

I created a 'Read More' button that opens up a modal popup with details about that specific course.

## Create a sign in

I made a 'Register' and 'Sign in' page. The information typed in 'Registration' is stored in Local Storage and fetched from 'Sign in' if the email and password are the same.

## Add Courses
